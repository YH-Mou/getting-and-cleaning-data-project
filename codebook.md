run_analysis.R is used to get and clean the data set.
1. Read the txt files.
2. Use appropriate names to name the variables
    features from "features.txt" : 561 rows, 2 columns
    activities from "activity_labels.txt" : 6 rows, 2 columns
    subject_test from "test/subject_test.txt" : 2947 rows, 1 column
    x_test from "test/X_test.txt" : 2947 rows, 561 columns 
    y_test from "test/y_test.txt" : 2947 rows, 1 columns 
    subject_train from "test/subject_train.txt" : 7352 rows, 1 column
    x_train from "test/X_train.txt" : 7352 rows, 561 columns 
    y_train from 'test/y_train.txt" : 7352 rows, 1 columns
    
 3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
      X (10299 * 561) is generated by merging `x_train` and `x_test` using rbind()
      Y (10299 * 1) is generated by merging `y_train` and `y_test` using rbind()
      Subject (10299 * 1) is generated by merging `subject_train` and `subject_test` using rbind()
      merge_data (10299 * 563) is generated by merging `Subject`, `Y` and `X` using cbind()
    
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
    tidydata (10299 * 88) is generated by subsetting merge_data, selecting only columns: 
      subject, code and also columns with names containing "mean" or "std" 
 
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    code column of the tidydata replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of activities

6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
    code to activities
    "Acc" in column's name replaced by "accelerometer"
    All "Gyro" in column's name replaced by "gyroscope"
    All "BodyBody" in column's name replaced by "body"
    All "Mag" in column's name replaced by "Magnitude"
    All start with character "f" in column's name replaced by "Frequency"
    All start with character "t" in column's name replaced by "Time"
    Make sure all names use lowercases

7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
   Group tidydata by subject and activity.
   tidydata_output (180 * 88) is generated by sumarizing groupped tidydata with the mean function.
   write tidydata_output into tidydata_output.txt file.
